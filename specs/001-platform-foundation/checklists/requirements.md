# Specification Quality Checklist: Backend Platform Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is an infrastructure feature, so "users" are developers. Component names such as gateway,
  registry and port numbers come from the constitution and the user's description and are
  treated as given constraints, not implementation choices; framework and library names are
  deliberately absent from the spec.
- Defaults chosen instead of clarification markers (route form, correlation ID header, echo
  public/protected paths, placeholder rate limits) are recorded in the Assumptions section.
